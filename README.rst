``objgraph`` is a module that lets you visually explore Python object graphs.

You'll need `graphviz <https://www.graphviz.org/>`_ if you want to draw
the pretty graphs.

I recommend `xdot <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xdot>`_ for interactive use.
``pip install xdot`` should suffice; objgraph will automatically look for it
in your ``PATH``.


Installation and Documentation
------------------------------

``pip install objgraph`` or `download it from PyPI
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/objgraph>`_.

Documentation lives at https://mg.pov.lt/objgraph.

History
-------

I've developed a set of functions that eventually became objgraph when I
was hunting for memory leaks in a Python program.  The whole story -- with
illustrated examples -- is in this series of blog posts:

* `Hunting memory leaks in Python
  <https://mg.pov.lt/blog/hunting-python-memleaks.html>`_
* `Python object graphs
  <https://mg.pov.lt/blog/python-object-graphs.html>`_
* `Object graphs with graphviz
  <https://mg.pov.lt/blog/object-graphs-with-graphviz.html>`_
