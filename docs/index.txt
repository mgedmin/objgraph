.. currentmodule:: objgraph


Quick start
-----------

Try this in a Python shell:

    >>> x = []
    >>> y = [x, [x], dict(x=x)]
    >>> import objgraph
    >>> objgraph.show_refs([y], filename='sample-graph.png')
    Graph written to ....dot (... nodes)
    Image generated as sample-graph.png

(If you've installed ``xdot``, omit the filename argument to get the
interactive viewer.)

You should see a graph like this:

.. figure:: sample-graph.png
   :alt: [graph of objects reachable from y]

If you prefer to handle your own file output, you can provide a file object to
the ``output`` parameter of ``show_refs`` and ``show_backrefs`` instead of a
filename. The contents of this file will contain the graph source in DOT format.


Backreferences
--------------

Now try

    >>> objgraph.show_backrefs([x], filename='sample-backref-graph.png')
    ... # doctest: +NODES_VARY
    Graph written to ....dot (8 nodes)
    Image generated as sample-backref-graph.png

and you'll see

.. figure:: sample-backref-graph.png
   :alt: [graph of objects from which y is reachable]
   :scale: 50%


Memory leak example
-------------------

The original purpose of :mod:`objgraph` was to help me find memory leaks.
The idea was to pick an object in memory that shouldn't be there and then
see what references are keeping it alive.

To get a quick overview of the objects in memory, use the imaginatively-named
:func:`show_most_common_types`:

    >>> objgraph.show_most_common_types() # doctest: +RANDOM_OUTPUT
    tuple                      5224
    function                   1329
    wrapper_descriptor         967
    dict                       790
    builtin_function_or_method 658
    method_descriptor          340
    weakref                    322
    list                       168
    member_descriptor          167
    type                       163

But that's looking for a small needle in a large haystack.  Can we limit
our haystack to objects that were created recently?  Perhaps.

Let's define a function that "leaks" memory

    >>> class MyBigFatObject(object):
    ...     pass
    ...
    >>> def computate_something(_cache={}):
    ...     _cache[42] = dict(foo=MyBigFatObject(),
    ...                       bar=MyBigFatObject())
    ...     # a very explicit and easy-to-find "leak" but oh well
    ...     x = MyBigFatObject() # this one doesn't leak

We take a snapshot of all the objects counts that are alive before
we call our function

    >>> objgraph.show_growth(limit=3) # doctest: +RANDOM_OUTPUT
    tuple                  5228     +5228
    function               1330     +1330
    wrapper_descriptor      967      +967

and see what changes after we call it

    >>> computate_something()
    >>> objgraph.show_growth() # doctest: +RANDOM_OUTPUT
    MyBigFatObject        2        +2
    dict                797        +1

It's easy to see :class:`MyBigFatObject` instances that appeared and were
not freed.  I can pick one of them at random and trace the reference chain
back to one of the garbage collector's roots.

For simplicity's sake let's assume all of the roots are modules.  ``objgraph``
provides a function, :func:`~objgraph.is_proper_module`, to check this. If
you've any examples where that isn't true, I'd love to hear about them
(although see :ref:`leaking-objects`).

    >>> import random
    >>> objgraph.show_chain(
    ...     objgraph.find_backref_chain(
    ...         random.choice(objgraph.by_type('MyBigFatObject')),
    ...         objgraph.is_proper_module),
    ...     filename='chain.png')
    Graph written to ...dot (13 nodes)
    Image generated as chain.png

.. figure:: chain.png
   :alt: [chain of references from a module to a MyBigFatObject instance]
   :scale: 50%

It is perhaps surprising to find :mod:`linecache` at the end of that chain
(apparently :mod:`doctest` monkey-patches it), but the important things --
:func:`computate_something` and its cache dictionary -- are in there.

There are other tools, perhaps better suited for memory leak hunting:
`heapy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/guppy>`_,
`Dozer <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Dozer>`_.

Reference counting bugs
-----------------------

Bugs in C-level reference counting may leave objects in memory that do not
have any other objects pointing at them.  You can find these by calling
:func:`get_leaking_objects`, but you'll have to filter out legitimate GC
roots from them, and there are a *lot* of those:

    >>> roots = objgraph.get_leaking_objects()
    >>> len(roots) # doctest: +RANDOM_OUTPUT
    4621

    >>> objgraph.show_most_common_types(objects=roots)
    ... # doctest: +RANDOM_OUTPUT
    tuple          4333
    dict           171
    list           74
    instancemethod 4
    listiterator   2
    MemoryError    1
    Sub            1
    RuntimeError   1
    Param          1
    Add            1

    >>> objgraph.show_refs(roots[:3], refcounts=True, filename='roots.png')
    ... # doctest: +NODES_VARY
    Graph written to ...dot (19 nodes)
    Image generated as roots.png
